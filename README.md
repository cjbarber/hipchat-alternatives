## HipChat Alternatives

#### Why?

HipChat is fantastic, however:

4/25/2014: HipChat Changed Their TOS To Allow Admins Access to 1-1 Chat History

4/27/2014: Response from HipChat regarding 1-1 chat access by admins - [Who can view chat history and files](http://help.hipchat.com/knowledgebase/articles/358098)

Edit:
5/22/2014: Having used Slack for a while, I hope HipChat improves! It's still a better experience than Slack, IMO. However, they really need to fix the multiple accounts/rooms issues.

Reviews from HipChat TOS Change Hacker News Thread:

> We use Slack at my company (switched to it from Kato) and we're very happy with it.

> Same [referring to above quote]. Though, it seems a tad overpriced. It is a very nice platform though

> Somewhat tangential to this story, but we recently moved our team over from HipChat to Slack [1]. I initially thought that we'd miss the sheer number of integrations HipChat offers, but Slack seems to cover almost all of the ones we use regularly and some HipChat doesn't yet offer, like Asana.

> Our team tried out Slack, but the Mac app isn't native, just a rather weak wrapper around the normal web page. And the web experience just isn't as good as HipChat.
Also, no in-app voice/video integration that I could find. HipChat's one-on-one video is great, although waht I really wish for is conferencing built in. Google Hangouts is just too annoying to set up (first it pesters me about signing up for Google Plus, which I don't want, then it shows a blank screen with a "start a hangout" button, then it opens a GH video in a separate window, which is just stupid), and doesn't have a desktop app.
